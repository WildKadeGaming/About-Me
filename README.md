# About Me
Hi, I'm Kade, but I got by Wild online. I'm a JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, and Lua developer. I am currently creating Discord bots, Unity and Unreal Games, and Unturned plugins.
I was raised in the Northwest United States and I am still attending school.
I dream to be an IT specialist, computer software engineer, and law enforcement officer with my Bachelors in Criminal Justice and Psychology.
Don't be afraid to reach out to me on Discord: WildKadeGaming#4605
If I'm not responding, I'm either busy or away. I typically am online a lot, so this should probably never be an issue.

## How I started
Originally I never wanted to program. I took a computer class in 6th grade, and I hated it. Never wanted to touch programming and dreaded it every single week.
But it's changed. A LOT. My Freshman year of high school I took a Computer Science class, I thought (at the time) that it would teach me the fundamentals of technology and how computers really work. Yeah no, it was all programming. I was getting a little into programming from a bit back because I was watching Brackey's Unity Game Engine tutorials on YouTube. So I really wanted to learn C#.
So after that class in Freshman year, I recieved a certification for JavaScript.
Afterwards, I continued on my own time to learn Java, and now Python and Lua (for Roblox).
I went from hating programming to it being one of the things I love to do for hours every day.
